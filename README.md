# university-labs-archive

The digital graveyard of academic mediocrity. A collection of C++ code that somehow passed university requirements despite violating every modern programming principle.

## What's Inside This Mess

### Core Labs (01)
- **Code Review**: Debug and Release versions of code that probably shouldn't have survived
- **Labs I-VI**: Progressive descent into madness with version control
  - Alpha builds: When we thought we knew what we were doing
  - Beta builds: When we realized we didn't

### Advanced Torture (02)
- **Lab 1**: Binary file operations that would make Linus cringe
- **Lab 2**: Custom string/vector implementations because std wasn't painful enough
- **Lab 3**: More suffering
- **Lab 4**: Unit tests that actually test your patience

### Extended Pain (ext)
- **04-08**: GUI experiments with Builder C++ that look like they're from 1995
- Some database operations that would make any DBA commit seppuku
- Mathematical visualizations that prove why we're not artists

## Build

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc) # Or just pray it works
```

## Dependencies

- C++ compiler (preferably one that doesn't judge your code)
- CMake 3.15+ (because we're masochists)
- Builder C++ (for the GUI nightmares)
- Your dignity (optional)

## Project Structure
Each lab is isolated to prevent cross-contamination of bad code. Version progression shows the descent from optimism to acceptance.

## Testing
Some attempts were made. Results were... inconclusive.

## License
GNU - Because someone might actually learn from these mistakes.

## Note
This code base serves as a testament to the fact that you can graduate without understanding pointers. Preserved in its original form as a warning to future generations.

Remember: "It's not stupid if it works" - But this might be the exception.
