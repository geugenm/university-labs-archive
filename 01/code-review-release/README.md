# Code review by first-year, group 4 student Eugene Hleba

## Brief structure description:

    The 'release' folder contains the compiled exe named like the cpp sources themselves

    In the 'scheme' folder there are function block diagrams in png and xml format, the xml is in a separate folder

    The 'source' file contains completely untouched code

    The 'source_commented' file is partially edited (for better understanding) and explained code. No algorithms, no logic has been changed.

    The 'source_remastered' file contains completely revised code.

## Block diagram:

GOST 19.701-90 standard was used to create block diagrams
